MODEL NEEDS TO HAVE path:pathOrFileName

= Introduction to CobiGen external plug-ins

Since October of 2019, a major change on CobiGen has taken place. CobiGen is written in Java code and previously, it was very hard for developers to create new plug-ins in other languages.

Creating a new plug-in means: 

* Being able to parse a file in that language.
* Create a human readable model that can be used to generate templates (by retrieving properties from the model).
* Enable merging files, so that user's code does not get removed.

For the Java plug-in it was relatively easy. As you are inside the Java world, you can use multiple utilities libraries in order to get the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree[AST] or to merge Java code. With this new feature, we wanted that behaviour to be possible for any programming language.

== General intuition

Below you will find a very high level description of how CobiGen worked in previous versions:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/oldCobiGen.png[Old CobiGen,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/oldCobiGen.png"]

Basically, when a new input file was sent to CobiGen, it called the input reader to create a model of it (see link:https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/cobigen-tsplugin#object-model[here] an example of a model). That model was sent to the template engine. 

Afterwards, the template engine generated a new file which had to be merged with the original one. All this code was implemented in Java.

On the new version, we have implemented a handler (`ExternalProcessHandler`) which connects through TCP/IP connection to a server (normally on localhost:5000). This server can be implemented in any language (.Net, Node.js, Python...) it just needs to implement a REST API defined here link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-template-plugin/blob/master/APIContract.yml[here]. The most important services are the input reading and merging:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/newCobiGen.png[New CobiGen,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/newCobiGen.png"]

CobiGen acts as a client that sends requests to the server in order to read the input file and create a model. The model is returned to the template engine so that it generates a new file. Finally, it is sent back to get merged with the original file.

== How to create new external plug-in

The creation of a new plug-in consists mainly in two steps:

* Creation of the server (external process).

* Creation of a CobiGen plug-in.

=== Server (external process)

The server can be programmed in any language that is able to implement REST services endpoints. The API that needs to implement is defined with link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-template-plugin/blob/master/APIContract.yml[this contract]. You can paste the content to https://editor.swagger.io/ for a better look. 

We have already created a NestJS server that implements the API defined above. You can find the code link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-nest-server/blob/master/src/processmanagement/processmanagement.controller.ts[here] which you can use as an example.

As you can see, the endpoints have the following naming convention: `processmanagement/todoplugin/nameOfService` where you will have to change `todo` to your plug-in name (e.g. rustplugin, pyplugin, goplugin...)

In order to test the server, you will have to deploy it on your local machine (localhost) and port 5000. If that port is already in use, you can deploy it on higher port values (5001, 5002...). Nevertheless, we explain HERE the testing process as you need to complete the next step before.

IMPORTANT: Your server must accept one argument when running it. The argument will be the port number (as an integer). This will be used for CobiGen in order to handle blocked ports when deploying your server. Check this link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-nest-server/blob/master/src/main.ts#L47[code] to see how we implemented that argument on our NestJS server.

=== CobiGen plug-in

You will have to create a new CobiGen plug-in that connects to the server. But *do not worry*, you will not have to implement anything new. We have a CobiGen plug-in template available, the only changes needed are renaming files and setting some properties on the pom.xml. Please follow these steps:

* Get the CobiGen plug-in template from link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-template-plugin[here]. It is a template repository (new GitHub feature), so you can click on "Use this template" as shown below:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/usePluginTemplate.png[Plugin CobiGen template,width="550"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/usePluginTemplate.png"]

* Name your repo as `cobigen-name-plugin` where `name` can be python, rust, go... In our case we will create a `nest` plug-in. It will create a repo with only one commit which contains all the needed files.

* Clone your just created repo and import folder `cobigen-todoplugin` as a Maven project on any Java IDE, though we recommend you devonfw ;)

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/importPluginEclipse.png[Import plugin,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/importPluginEclipse.png"]

* Rename all the `todoplugin` folders, file and class names to `nameplugin`. In our case `nestplugin`. In Eclipse you can easily rename by right clicking and then refactor -> rename:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/renamePlugin.png[Rename plugin,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/renamePlugin.png"]

NOTE: We recommend you to select all the checkboxes

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/renameCheckbox.png[Rename checkbox,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/renameCheckbox.png"]

The generation can create a full Angular 6 client using the devon4ng-application-template package located at workspaces/examples folder of the distribution. For more details about this package, please refer link:https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template[here].

* Remember to change all the package, files and class names to use your plug-in name, in `src/main/java` and `src/main/test` The final result would be:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/packageStructure.png[Package structure,width="300"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/packageStructure.png"]

* Now we just need to change some strings, this is needed for CobiGen to register all the different plugins (they need unique names). In class `TodoPluginActivator` (in our case `NestPluginActivator`), change all the `todo` to your plug-in name. See below the 3 strings that need to be changed:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/pluginActivator.png[Plugin activator,width="450"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/pluginActivator.png"]


* Finally, we will change some properties from the `pom.xml` of the project. These properties define the server (external process) that is going to be used:

.. Inside `pom.xml`, press _Ctrl + F_ to perform a find and replace operation. Replace all `todo` with your plugin name: 

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/setPomProperties.png[Pom properties,width="550"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/setPomProperties.png"]

.. We are going to explain the server properties: 

... artifactId: This is the name of your plug-in, that will be used for a future release on Maven Central.

... plugin.name: does not need to be changed as it uses the property from the `artifactId`. When connecting to the server, it will send a request to `localhost:5000/{plugin.name}plugin/isConnectionReady`, that is why it is important to use an unique name for the plug-in.

... server.name: This defines how the server executable (_.exe_) file will be named. This _.exe_ file contains all the needed resources for deploying the server. You can use any name you want.

... server.version: You will specify here the server version that needs to be used. The _.exe_ file will be named as `{server.name}-{server.version}.exe`.

... server.url: This will define from where to download the server. We *really* recommend you using NPM which is a package manager we know it works fine. We explain <<release_server, here>> how to release the server on NPM. This will download the _.exe_ file for Windows.

... server.url.linux: Same as before, but this should download the _.exe_ file for Linux systems. If you do not want to implement a Linux version of the plug-in, just use the same URL from MacOS or Windows.

... server.url.macos: Same as before, but this should download the _.exe_ file for MacOS systems. If you do not want to implement a MacOS version of the plug-in, just use the same URL from Linux or Windows.

== Testing phase

Now that you have finished with the implementation of the server and the creation of a new CobiGen plug-in, we are going to explain how you can test that everything works fine:

[[release_server]]
=== Release the server

We are going to use link:https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM] to store the executable of our server. Even though NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, it can be used for our purpose.

* Get the CobiGen server template from link:https://github.com/jdiazgon/cobigen-template-server[here]. It is a template repository (new GitHub feature), so you can click on "Use this template" as shown below:

image::images/howtos/todo-plugin/useServerTemplate.png[Server CobiGen template,width="550"link="images/howtos/todo-plugin/useServerTemplate.png"]

* Name your repo as `cobigen-name-server` where `name` can be python, rust, go... In our case we will create a `nest` plug-in. It will create a repo with only one commit which contains all the needed files.

* Clone your just created repo and go to folder `cobigen-todo-server`. It will just contain two files: _ExternalProcessContract.yml_ is the OpenAPI definition which you can modify with your own server definition (this step is optional), and _package.json_ is a file needed for NPM in order to define where to publish this package:

```JSON
{
  "name": "@devonfw/cobigen-todo-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Todo server to implement the input reader and merger for CobiGen",
  "author": "CobiGen Team",
  "license": "Apache"
}
```

Those are the default properties. This would push a new package `cobigen-todo-server` on the `devonfw` organization, with version 1.0.0. We have no restrictions here, you can use any organization, though we always recommend devonfw.

NOTE: Remember to change all the `todo` to your server name. 

* Add your executable file into the `cobigen-todo-server` folder, just like below. As we said previously, this _.exe_ is the server ready to be deployed.

----
cobigen-template-server/
 |- cobigen-todo-server/
   |- ExternalProcessContract.yml
   |- package.json
   |- todoserver-1.0.1.exe
----

* Finally, we have to publish to NPM. If you have never done it, you can follow this link:https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-a-beautiful-tiny-npm-package-and-publish-it-2881d4307f78/[tutorial]. Basically you need to login into NPM and run:

[source, cmd]
npm publish --access=public

That's it! You have published the first version of your server. Now you just need to modify the properties defined on the pom of your CobiGen plug-in. Please see next section for more information.

=== Finishing CobiGen plug-in

== Requisites

Install yarn globally:



== Angular 6 workspace

The output location of the generation can be defined editing the *__cobigen.properties__* file located at *__crud_angular_client_app/templates__* folder of the *__CobiGen_Templates__* project.

image::images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_7.png[cobigen.properties file,width="450"link="images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_7.png"]

By default, the output path would be into the __devon4ng-application-template__ folder at the root of the devon4j project parent folder: 

----
root/
 |- devon4ng-application-template/
 |- devon4j-project-parent/
   |- core/
   |- server/
----

However, this path can be changed, for example to __src/main/client__ folder of the devon4j project:

[source, txt]
relocate: ./src/main/client/${cwd}

----
root/
 |- devon4j-project-parent/
   |- core/
      |- src
        |- main
          |- client
   |- server/
----

Once the output path is chosen, copy the files of link:https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template[DEVON4NG-APPLICATION-TEMPLATE] repository into this output path. 

== Install Node dependencies

Open a terminal into devon4ng-application-template copied and just run the command:

[source, bash]
yarn

This will start the installation of all node packages needed by the project into the node_modules folder.

== Generating

From an Eto object, right click, CobiGen -> Generate will show the CobiGen wizard relative to client generation:

image::images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_1.png[CobiGen Client Generation Wizard,width="450"link="images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_1.png"]

Check all the increments realtive to Angular:

[NOTE]
=======
The Angular devon4j URL increment is only needed for the first generations however, checking it again on next generation will not cause any problem.
=======

As we done on other generations, we click Next to choose which fields to include at the generation or simply clicking Finish will start the generation.

image::images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_3.png[CobiGen Client Generation Wizard 3,width="450"link="images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_3.png"]

== Routing

Due to the nature of the TypeScript merger, currently is not possible to merge properly the array of paths objects of the routings at app.routing.ts file so, this modification should be done by hand on this file. However, the import related to the new component generated is added.

This would be the generated `app-routing.module` file:
[source, ts]
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';
import { AuthGuard } from './shared/security/auth-guard.service';
import { InitialPageComponent } from './initial-page/initial-page.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { SampleDataGridComponent } from './sampledata/sampledata-grid/sampledata-grid.component';
//Routing array
const appRoutes: Routes = [{
    path: 'login',
    component: LoginComponent
}, {
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent,
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
    children: [{
        path: '',
        redirectTo: '/home/initialPage',
        pathMatch: 'full',
        canActivate: [AuthGuard]
    }, {
        path: 'initialPage',
        component: InitialPageComponent,
        canActivate: [AuthGuard]
    }]
}, {
    path: '**',
    redirectTo: '/login',
    pathMatch: 'full'
}];
export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes);

Adding the following into the children object of `home`, will add into the side menu the entry for the component generated:

[source, ts]
{
    path: 'sampleData',
    component: SampleDataGridComponent,
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
} 

[source, ts]
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';
import { AuthGuard } from './shared/security/auth-guard.service';
import { InitialPageComponent } from './initial-page/initial-page.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { SampleDataGridComponent } from './sampledata/sampledata-grid/sampledata-grid.component';
//Routing array
const appRoutes: Routes = [{
    path: 'login',
    component: LoginComponent
}, {
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent,
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
    children: [{
        path: '',
        redirectTo: '/home/initialPage',
        pathMatch: 'full',
        canActivate: [AuthGuard]
    }, {
        path: 'initialPage',
        component: InitialPageComponent,
        canActivate: [AuthGuard]
    }, {
        path: 'sampleData',
        component: SampleDataGridComponent,
        canActivate: [AuthGuard],
    }]
}, {
    path: '**',
    redirectTo: '/login',
    pathMatch: 'full'
}];
export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes);

== JWT Authentication

If you are using a back end server with JWT Authentication (there is a sample in workspaces/folder called *sampleJwt*) you have to specify the Angular application to use this kind of authentication.

By default the variable is set to ‘csrf’ but you can change it to JWT by going to the link:https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template/blob/develop/src/environments/environment.ts#L10[Enviroment.ts] and setting `security: 'jwt'`.

== Running

First of all, run your devon4j java server by right clicking over SpringBootApp.java Run As -> Java Application. This will start to run the SpringBoot server. Once you see the Started SpringBoot in XX seconds, the backend is running.

image::images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_4.png[Starting SpringBoot,width="450"link="images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_4.png"]

Once the the server is running, open a Devon console at the output directory defined previously and run:

[source, cmd]
ng serve --open

This will run the Angular 6 application at:

[source, URL]
http://localhost:4200

image::images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_5.png[Running Angular 6 app,width="450"link="images/howtos/angular4-gen/ng4gen_5.png"]

Once finished, the browser will open automatically at the previous localhost URL showing the Angular 6 application, using the credentials set at the devon4j java server you will be able to access.
